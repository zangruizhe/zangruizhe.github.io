### OO VS FP

接下来我想讨论一下 OO 和 FP. 先说结论:

> 只使用任何一个都不能写出能快速交付, 同时又容易维护的代码工程. 
> 
> 我们需要结合这两种编程模式的优点, 谨慎使用这些思想工具, 尤其是OO, 如果过度使用OO的一些编程思想, 例如: 继承, 代码会很快变得难以理解和维护.

未完待续...

### OO VS FP

Now I want to talk briefly about Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional Programming (FP). My conclusion is: 

> using either approach alone won't help you write code that's both quick to deliver and easy to maintain.
> 
> We need to combine the best of both worlds and use these ideas carefully. This is especially true for OO - overusing OO concepts (for example: inheritance) can quickly make code hard to understand and maintain.

To be continued…
